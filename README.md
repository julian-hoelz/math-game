## Explanation

On November 13th, 2024, there was an action day at bbw SÃ¼dhessen, my training company. To give students interested in computer science a glimpse into programming, I programmed this math game in advance. The goal of the game is to solve ten arithmetic problems in the shortest time possible. Those who are particularly fast can secure a spot on the leaderboard.
